    <h1><font color="red">HIRAKANI BURUJ</font></h1><br><br>
    <p>The fort has a famous wall called "Hirakani Buruj" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steepcliff. The legend goes "that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby 
        village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant 
        son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. 
        She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and was rewarded for her bravery." In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
        built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.</p><br><br>
